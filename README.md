# JavaMapGraphing
Application developed to visualise user input recursive networks. Please note that commit message conventions for this project are not reflective of current working standards - 
my focus for this project was on being able to produce an application to define and view city structures for limited purpose, of course for maintainability purposes several
improvements are required.
